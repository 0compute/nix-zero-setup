# Glossary

**Anchor:** Writing a release fingerprint (digest or Merkle root) to an
immutable ledger so it cannot be silently changed later.

**[ANT catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_catalog):** NSA's classified
menu of hardware and software implants for targeted surveillance, leaked by
Snowden in 2013. Documents implants for network equipment, hard drives, and
server firmware.

**[Attestation](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model):** A verifiable record that
a specific build occurred from specified inputs by a known builder. See also:
in-toto, Rekor, OIDC, Registry.

**[BGP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271):** Border Gateway Protocol
(RFC 4271). The routing protocol that directs traffic between autonomous systems
on the internet. BGP hijacking redirects traffic through an adversary-controlled

Delivery Network. A geographically distributed network of proxy servers that
cache and serve content to end users from nearby nodes. Major CDN operators
(Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai) are US-incorporated or subject to US jurisdiction.

**[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration):** Continuous
Integration. The practice of automating the integration of code changes from
multiple contributors into a single software project.

**[Closure](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable/glossary#gloss-closure):** The

global hierarchical naming system that translates human-readable domain names to
IP addresses.

**[Dual_EC_DRBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG):** Dual Elliptic

and operations. Private keys cannot be exported; signing occurs inside the
device.

**[HUMINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence_(intelligence_gathering)):**
Human Intelligence. Intelligence gathered through interpersonal contact:
recruitment, social engineering, or insider threats. Technical controls do not
address HUMINT; key ceremony discipline and HSM-resident keys limit insider
blast radius.

**[ICANN](https://www.icann.org/):** Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and

Used here for governance (builder key rotation and revocation) to prevent
unilateral control. See also: N-of-M.

**N-of-M:** Out of `M` configured builders, at least `N` independent builders
must report the same result.

**[NAR](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable/glossary):** Nix Archive. Canonical
binary serialization of a Nix store path, used as the input to
content-addressing. The NAR digest of a path must match its declaration;
mismatch fails the build.

**[narinfo](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable/package-management/binary-cache-substituter):**
Metadata file in a Nix binary cache describing a store path: its NAR digest,
references, deriver, and optional signature. Fetched by a substituter before
downloading the NAR archive.

framework (RFC 6749) for delegated authorization without exposing credentials.
The basis for OIDC identity assertions used in keyless signing.

**[OCI](https://opencontainers.org/):** Open Container Initiative. Industry
standards for container image format, distribution, and runtime.

**[OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/):** OpenID Connect. Identity layer on
OAuth 2.0. Used here for keyless signing: a CI platform issues a short-lived
OIDC token asserting the workflow identity, which cosign uses as the signing
credential.

**[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/):** Vendor-neutral observability
framework for collecting traces, metrics, and logs. Used here to instrument CI
job phases (seed pull, mount, build) with structured spans for timing analysis.

**[P-256](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/186/5/final):** NIST P-256 elliptic
curve (secp256r1), defined in FIPS 186-5. Used in ECDSA. NIST-standardized and
widely deployed; treat as potentially weakened given the Dual_EC_DRBG precedent.

**[PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM):** NSA program for collection of
stored internet communications directly from major US tech companies under FISA
Section 702 authority.

**[QUANTUM INSERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUANTUM_INSERT):** NSA/GCHQ

man-on-the-side attack. The attacker races the legitimate server response with a
crafted packet.

**[Registry](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec):** An
OCI-compliant service for storing and distributing container images and
artifacts. Addressed by content digest (immutable) or by tag (mutable). In this
design, registry tags are non-authoritative; the image digest is the release
pointer.

**[Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor):** Sigstore's immutable,
append-only transparency log for software supply chain attestations. Entries are
publicly verifiable; the log is operated by the Sigstore project.

**Ephemeral runner:** Executes CI job steps. Runners start fresh on every job
with no persistent state.

**[sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/):** Open-source project providing
infrastructure for signing, transparency, and verification of software
artifacts. Comprises cosign, Rekor, and Fulcio.

**[SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement):** Service Level
Agreement. A contractual commitment on availability, reliability, and support
response time. Rekor (Sigstore's transparency log) carries no enterprise SLA;
an outage blocks attestation in Dev mode.

**[SORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM):** Sistema
Operativno-Rozysknikh Meropriyatiy (System for Operative Investigative
Activities). Russian federal law requiring telecommunications operators to
install equipment providing FSB with real-time access to all communications
traffic, without a warrant.

**[Substituter](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/conf-file#conf-substituters):**
A Nix binary cache endpoint. When enabled, Nix fetches pre-built store paths
from the substituter instead of building locally from source. See also: NAR.

**[SUNBURST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach):**

SolarWinds Orion build system and inserted a backdoor signed with the legitimate
code-signing key, affecting thousands of organizations including US federal
agencies.

**[TAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations):** Tailored
Access Operations. NSA division responsible for active exploitation of foreign
targets, including hardware implants and network-level attacks.

**[TLS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446):** Transport Layer Security
(RFC 8446). Cryptographic protocol that encrypts network traffic between two
parties. Protects against passive eavesdropping but not against a provider
compelled to cooperate or a network-level man-on-the-side attacker (see QUANTUM
INSERT).

**[Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210):** Ken
Thomson's seminal attack: a compiler can be modified to insert a backdoor into
programs it compiles, including a modified copy of itself into compilers it
compiles, making the backdoor invisible in source. Defeated by bootstrapping the
compiler chain from a human-auditable binary seed rather than an opaque binary.
