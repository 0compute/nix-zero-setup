# Nix Seed: Design

> New to these terms? See [Glossary](./GLOSSARY.md).

Happy-path builds - application code change only, no dependency update - start
in under 10 seconds on any ephemeral runner. The dependency
[closure][closure] is already packaged; pull, mount, build. No `/nix/store`
reconstruction.

The setup tax of cold closure reconstruction is a one-time cost per seed,
shared across all subsequent jobs. Dependency changes trigger a seed rebuild;
everything else is free.

Every build is cryptographically bound to its source: what is in git is
exactly what was built. This is enforced by the linkage between source commit,
dependency closure, and output artifact - not assumed.

## Architecture

The release pointer is the OCI image digest
(`ghcr.io/org/repo.seed@sha256:<digest>`). [Registry][oci-registry] tags and
metadata are non-authoritative.

Layering is handled by
[nix2container](https://github.com/nlewo/nix2container); execution by workflow
scripts external to the container.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Guarantee boundary.** Nix Seed verifies reproducibility and provenance
> from declared inputs. It does not prove the absence of firmware implants,
> compromised hardware roots of trust, or malicious maintainers with valid
> signing authority. These threats require operational controls (key ceremony,
> hardware trust policy, personnel/process controls), not software-only fixes.

### Performance

- Closure realization is replaced by pulling and mounting an [OCI][oci]
  filesystem image, dropping [CI][ci] setup time from ~90 seconds (standard
  Nix cache fetch) to <10 seconds.
- Setup cost scales with dependency change since the last seed.
- Source fetch (shallow clone size) is unchanged.
- Build execution time is unchanged.

<!-- TODO: link actual job runs from the examples. -->

#### Instrumentation

Jobs are instrumented with [OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry] spans for:

- seed pull
- mount ready
- build start
- seed build (when a new seed is required before the app build)
- digest verification

Primary metric: time-to-build (setup time).

#### Comparisons

Nix Seed generates CI workflows that benchmark setup-time against cache-based
approaches (public binary cache, `actions/cache`) so the improvement is
measurable, not assumed.

The benchmark command is:

- `nix develop --command true`

#### Constraints

- Darwin builds must be run on macOS builders if they require Apple SDKs. A
  runner with a differing SDK version produces a differing NAR digest and
  fails deterministically.

### Build Output

Nix Seed's output is a Nix store path. The project build runs inside the seed
container and writes its result to the local Nix store. The release pointer is
the content-addressed digest of that output: a NAR digest for store path
outputs, an OCI image digest for container outputs. The trust and attestation
model is identical in both cases: the in-toto statement binds the output
artifact digest, and (in Zero) that digest is anchored on-chain.

For distribution, [Cachix](https://cachix.org/) provides a managed binary
cache service for store path results. Cachix push credentials are a deployment
secret, not a trust root. Container outputs are pushed to an OCI registry.
Cachix is not required when all outputs are container images; it is recommended
for store path outputs and dev shells.

Output references are system-qualified at evaluation time: `apps.default`
resolves to `apps.x86_64-linux.default` on an x86_64-linux builder. All
configured outputs are built in parallel. Projects with large independent
outputs should use separate CI jobs per output to distribute build load across
dedicated runners.

Nix store signing (`nix store sign`) attaches an [Ed25519][ed25519] signature
to each [narinfo][narinfo] in the cache, binding the store path to the
signer's key. A consumer configured with `trusted-public-keys` verifies the
signature before accepting a substituted path. In Zero, store signing is
complementary to the on-chain quorum: a compromised cache can serve a valid
signature only if the signing key is also compromised, while the anchored
digest provides an independent ground truth.

### Building Containers

> Nix Seed is not a container-building tool. Container images are one possible
> Nix derivation output. Their layers are store paths, packaged by
> [nix2container](https://github.com/nlewo/nix2container). Nothing about a
> container build is special relative to any other Nix output.

The release pointer for a container build is the OCI image digest
(`ghcr.io/org/repo@sha256:<digest>`). Registry tags and metadata are
non-authoritative. An OCI registry is required to store and distribute
container outputs; a CI provider with a co-located registry is preferred for
performance.

`nix2container` is a pinned flake input; its digest is verified by the Nix
build system under the same supply-chain trust model as all other dependencies.

#### Seed Container

The seed container is the primary example: a standard `nix2container` build
that packages the project's dependency closure. It inherits all the properties
above - its layers are store paths, its release pointer is an OCI image digest,
and it is stored in an OCI registry.

What distinguishes it is its purpose: it ships pre-built dependencies so the
project build can start immediately. The project output - store path, container
image, binary - is produced inside it.

Nix Seed itself is a pinned flake input, subject to the same supply-chain
trust model as everything it builds.

**Build steps:**

1. Evaluate the project's Nix closure.
1. `nix2container` produces an OCI image whose layers correspond to store
   paths, plus a metadata manifest containing the image digest.
1. Push the image to an OCI registry.

Seed builds are executed offline (`--network none`). Source retrieval MUST be
pinned to a commit digest (never a mutable branch ref). `flake.lock` integrity
is verified by Nix evaluation; mismatches fail by design.

### Trust

#### Bootstrap Chain

> The source was clean, the build hermetic, but the compiler was pwned.

The [Trusting Trust][trusting-trust] attack has no software fix. The only
protection is a compiler chain that terminates at a human-auditable ground
truth.

The Nixpkgs chain builds through:

- The initial binary, [stage0-posix](https://github.com/oriansj/stage0-posix),
  a self-hosting assembler whose bootstrap binary is a few hundred bytes of
  hex-encoded machine instructions - there is no opaque compiler binary to
  trust.
- [GNU Mes](https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) - a minimal C compiler and
  Scheme interpreter bootstrapped entirely from the assembler
- [tcc](https://bellard.org/tcc/)
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [live-bootstrap](https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap).

The entire chain is coordinated with
[bootstrappable.org](https://bootstrappable.org/).

**Cost is already paid.** Full source bootstrap exists in nixpkgs regardless
of this project. Seed images cache its output: the first build after a seed
update pays the bootstrap cost once; subsequent CI jobs pull pre-built layers.

Consumers who need independent verification can rebuild from the stage0 binary,
reproduce the full closure, and check the digest against the anchored value.
This is a one-time audit activity that takes on the order of days of compute,
not a per-release operation. The content-addressed layers provide a direct
correspondence between what is pulled and what was built.

#### Quorum

> [!WARNING]
>
> Reproducible builds are a hard prerequisite. Without reproducibility,
> diverging digests are indistinguishable from a subverted build - the system
> cannot determine which builder is correct and quorum fails permanently.
>
> Verify with `nix build --check`. See
> [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

Releases require N-of-M builder agreement on the image
digest. No single build is trusted alone.

Quorum is only meaningful if builders span independent failure domains:
organization, jurisdiction, infrastructure, and identity issuer.

**Signing identity independence** requires that no single operator controls
the signing identities of multiple quorum builders. In Credulous, identity is
established via OIDC issuer: GitHub Actions
(`token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) and Azure Pipelines
(`vstoken.dev.azure.com`) share a Microsoft-controlled issuer and do not
satisfy identity independence when combined. In Zero, identity is established
by registered contract key; OIDC issuer is not a factor.

**Choosing N:** each of the N required builders should have a distinct
`corporateParent`, `jurisdiction`, and signing identity. N >= 3 is a practical
minimum; below that a single adversary controlling two independent entities can
forge a majority. Unanimous (M-of-M) is the strongest guarantee. See
[`modules/seedcfg.nix`](modules/seedcfg.nix) and
[`modules/builders.nix`](modules/builders.nix) for the builder registry
schema.

**Timing:** in Credulous with N-of-M and a deadline, a party controlling
M-N builders can delay attestation to ensure the deciding N-th vote comes from
a builder of their choice. Zero eliminates this: attestations accumulate
indefinitely and quorum is declared when the threshold is met, not when a
timer expires.

Disagreement among builders is not a bug - it is the protocol. Release is
blocked until quorum agrees on the same digest.

#### Levels

##### Innocent

Single builder.

##### Credulous

> [!WARNING]
>
> Credulous depends on [Rekor][rekor] availability and external [OIDC][oidc]
> trust roots. N-of-M quorum requires a central actor, the "master builder",
> to coordinate the promotion flow.

Each project maintains a `.seed.lock` containing a digest per target system:

```json
{
  "aarch64-darwin": "sha256:...",
  "aarch64-linux": "sha256:...",
  "x86_64-darwin": "sha256:...",
  "x86_64-linux": "sha256:..."
}
```

If no digest exists for a system, the seed is built, the resulting digest is
recorded in a new commit containing the updated `.seed.lock`, and the normal
build proceeds.

After each build, an [in-toto][in-toto] statement is generated describing
inputs and build metadata, signed via [OIDC][oidc]/[KMS][kms] using
[cosign][cosign], logged to [Rekor][rekor], and published to the registry as
a referrer artifact keyed by the build result digest. No mutable registry
state is trusted.

An SBOM (SPDX or CycloneDX) is generated from the output closure and published
as an OCI referrer artifact alongside the in-toto statement. This applies to
both seed builds and project builds.

At minimum, the statement must bind:

- source repository URI
- source commit digest
- flake.lock content digest
- target `system`
- output artifact digest
- SBOM digest
- builder identity and issuer
- build timestamp and workflow run ID

**Consumption:**

1. Read seed digest for the current system from `.seed.lock`.
1. Verify: attestation signature is valid; Rekor log inclusion is valid;
   statement contents match expected inputs.
1. Execute build steps in seed container by digest.

>
> Rekor has no enterprise [SLA][sla]. If Rekor is unavailable, quorum cannot
> be reached and builds fail.
>
> [!NOTE]
>
> Builder cache configuration ([substituters][substituter]) is not attested

A *seed release* is a set of image digests, one per target system. This is
distinct from a project release (git tag); a project release may reference one
or more seed releases.

The on-chain record is intentionally minimal to limit [calldata][calldata]
cost. Each builder additionally produces an [in-toto][in-toto] statement
binding full provenance:

- source repository URI
- source commit digest (full 40-hex SHA-1 or 64-hex SHA-256)
- `flake.lock` content digest
- target `system`
- output artifact digest
- SBOM digest
- builder identity (contract address)
- build metadata (`nix show-config` output, workflow run ID)

Each builder signs the statement with its registered key (not [OIDC][oidc])
and publishes it to the OCI registry as a referrer artifact keyed by the build
result digest. An SBOM (SPDX or CycloneDX) is generated from the output
closure and published as a separate OCI referrer artifact. [Rekor][rekor] is
not used; the OCI registry hosts the provenance.
The contract anchor proves N builders agreed on the digest; the in-toto
statements prove what was built.

Registry operators MUST guarantee referrer retention and API support required
to retrieve provenance for the full artifact lifetime. Production deployments
SHOULD replicate provenance artifacts to a secondary registry or immutable
archive to reduce single-registry loss/corruption risk.

```

Storing the full in-toto statement on-chain is feasible but not recommended.
A typical statement is 1,000-2,000 bytes; at 16 gas per non-zero calldata byte
that adds roughly 16,000-32,000 gas per builder per system - a 10-20x increase
in calldata cost - and bloats L2 data availability. Instead, the statement
digest is anchored on-chain (32 bytes, negligible cost) as a fourth parameter
`attest(commit, system, digest, in_toto_digest)`. This binds the off-chain
provenance to the quorum record without the size cost.

Each builder holds a persistent signing key registered in the contract at
genesis. A build produces a single on-chain transaction:

```solidity
attest(commit, system, digest, in_toto_digest)
```

signed by the builder's registered key. The contract records
`(commit, system, digest, in_toto_digest, builder_address, block_number)` for
each submission, then:

1. Checks that N distinct registered builders have submitted the same
   `(commit, system, digest, in_toto_digest)` tuple.
1. Verifies independence constraints across the N builders (`corporateParent`,
   `jurisdiction`, infrastructure, substituters).
1. When quorum is satisfied across all target systems, publishes the digest
   tree as a single [Merkle root][merkle-root]:
   - hash function = `keccak256`
   - leaf bytes =
     `0x00 || u16be(len(system)) || utf8(system) || imageDigestBytes`
   - internal node bytes = `0x01 || leftHash || rightHash`
   - leaf order = lexical ascending by `system`
   - odd leaf handling = duplicate the final leaf at each level
   - root = Merkle root across all systems
1. The anchored root is immutable.

No deadline is required. The contract accumulates attestations indefinitely;
quorum is declared when the threshold is met. The blockchain is the
transparency log - no separate log service is required.

**Master-builder trust is eliminated from the promotion path.** The contract
promotes a release when quorum is met - no coordinator, no single point of
authority.

**Key management:** builder keys are persistent secrets held in CI secret
stores. In Zero, signing keys SHOULD be non-exportable and backed by
HSM/KMS-HSM class infrastructure if costs permit. Raw private keys stored
directly in CI secret stores are NOT RECOMMENDED for Zero. Compromise triggers
revocation via the contract's governance [multi-sig][multi-sig] (see
[Governance Constraints](#governance-constraints)).

**Why CI key compromise still matters:** the contract verifies that `N`
distinct registered builder keys signed the same tuple. It does not distinguish
an authorized signer from an attacker using a stolen key. If fewer than `N`
keys are compromised, quorum blocks promotion; if `N` or more are compromised,
a malicious digest can satisfy quorum until revocation occurs.

Builders must enforce `substituters =` (empty) and `trusted-substituters =`
(empty). The effective `nix show-config` output is included in the in-toto
statement so verifiers can reject substituted builds.

Verifier policy MUST fail closed on any of the following:

- missing in-toto statement, signature, or signature-chain verification failure
- signer identity not in registered builder set
- missing required predicate fields (source URI, commit digest, `flake.lock`
  digest, target `system`, output digest)
- source URI/commit/`flake.lock` mismatch versus expected build inputs
- `nix show-config` indicates non-empty `substituters` or
  `trusted-substituters`
- missing or invalid inclusion proof for the anchored per-system digest

> [!NOTE]
>
> The L2 contract verifies the *claim* of independence via attested build
> metadata, not a cryptographic proof of local execution. A compromised builder
> can spoof its `nix show-config` output. Quorum still limits the damage: this
> only matters if N or more builders are simultaneously compromised and
> coordinating the same lie.

The `.seed.lock` file is not used.

**Consumption:** The contract must not be empty; see [Genesis](#genesis).

1. Query the L2 contract for the current anchored Merkle root.
1. Fetch the off-chain Merkle inclusion proof and verify it against the
   L2-anchored root.
1. Fetch in-toto provenance statements from OCI artifact; verify each
   signature against the builder's registered contract address; verify
   statement contents match expected source URI, commit, and `flake.lock`
   digest.
1. Execute build steps in seed container by digest.

Contract quorum verification subsumes the Rekor log check. In-toto provenance
is verified separately via the OCI artifact.

###### Configuration Registry

The contract is the authoritative source for all verification parameters:
builder set, registered keys, N, M, and independence constraints
(`corporateParent`, `jurisdiction`, infrastructure).

The flake's `seedCfg` is a local declaration used for Credulous only. It
should be pruned when moving to Zero.

Changes take effect only when a governance transaction updates the contract,
requiring approval from the governance multi-sig (see [Governance
Constraints](#governance-constraints)).

This closes the obvious attack: repo write access does not confer the ability
to redefine the trust model. Genesis (below) is the ceremony that populates
the registry for the first time.

###### RPC availability

Contract reads are `eth_call` (view functions) - no transaction, no gas,
50-300ms on a reliable L2 RPC provider. Not a CI bottleneck. The real concern
is availability: if the RPC is down, verification fails closed and builds stop.
Mitigations:

- Configure multiple RPC endpoints; fail through to a secondary on error.
- Cache the last known Merkle root locally with its block number; re-fetch on
  block advance.
- Apply the same jurisdiction independence requirement to RPC providers as to
  builders: a single US-provider RPC is a single failure domain.

###### Genesis

The first seed has no prior quorum to bootstrap from. Genesis is a controlled
ceremony distinct from normal builds:

1. All configured builders (M-of-M, unanimous) build the seed independently
   from source.
1. Each builder submits a genesis attestation to the contract via their
   registered key.
1. The contract requires unanimous attestation and verifies full independence
   across all M builders before accepting the genesis root.
1. Genesis is finalized by a multi-signature transaction requiring all M
   builder keys; no single party can unilaterally declare genesis.
1. An empty contract state rejects all non-genesis builds. Genesis must be
   completed before any seed can be consumed.

Post-genesis builds use the standard N-of-M threshold. The genesis root is the
immutable trust anchor.

Operationally, deployments MUST maintain incident runbooks for: key loss,
builder unavailability, builder compromise/revocation, and emergency quorum
reconfiguration.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Air-gapping builder hardware during the genesis ceremony eliminates the risk
> of network-level attacks on the trust anchor. This is best practice but
> expensive. Firmware injection remains a risk.

###### Gas Costs

[Gas][gas] cost depends on [calldata][calldata] size, state writes, and
current L2 fee conditions. The ranges below are planning estimates for a quorum
of 3 builders across 4 systems (`aarch64-darwin`, `aarch64-linux`,
`x86_64-darwin`, `x86_64-linux`), not guarantees.

- `attest(commit, system, digest, in_toto_digest)` submission
  (per builder per system):
  - expected gas: 120,000 to 220,000
  - expected cost: 0.00006 to 0.00022 ETH
  - expected USD (ETH = $3,000): $0.18 to $0.66
- total attestations (3 builders x 4 systems = 12 submissions):
  - expected gas: 1,440,000 to 2,640,000
  - expected cost: 0.00072 to 0.00264 ETH
  - expected USD (ETH = $3,000): $2.16 to $7.92
- root publication (once quorum is met for all 4 systems):
  - expected gas: 180,000 to 320,000
  - expected cost: 0.00009 to 0.00032 ETH
  - expected USD (ETH = $3,000): $0.27 to $0.96

Total anchoring overhead per release: 0.00081 to 0.00296 ETH ($2.43 to $8.88
at ETH = $3,000), excluding unusual fee spikes.

###### Governance Constraints

- Governance multi-sig must be independent from builder keys.
- Threshold should be at least 2-of-3 for emergency revocation/rotation.
- If a genesis key is lost before finalization, restart genesis with a new
  builder set and publish a signed incident record.
- If keys are lost post-finalization such that the multi-sig drops below the
  rotation threshold (e.g., 2-of-3), the L2 contract is permanently bricked
  for that project and requires a hard fork to a new contract.
- If a builder is revoked post-genesis, re-evaluate affected releases and
  republish status.

### Implicit Trust Boundary

While the design mitigates many attack vectors, it relies on two fundamental
trust assumptions:

1. **The `flake.lock` Bottleneck:** Nix Seed guarantees *what is in git is
   what is built*. If a maintainer merges a malicious dependency update into
   `flake.lock`, Nix Seed will faithfully build, attest, and anchor the
   malware. The cryptographic system does not audit code intent; it only binds
   the output to the input. Human review of lockfile updates remains a
   critical security boundary.
1. **Registry Tampering:** The OCI registry is treated as an untrusted blob
   store. The trust boundary assumes the local OCI client (Docker/Podman/
   Skopeo) correctly verifies that the digest of the fetched content matches
   the requested digest. We trust the math of content-addressing, not the
   service providing the bytes.

The [xz-utils backdoor (2024)](https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/) demonstrated
that highly resourced, patient adversaries will execute multi-year social
engineering campaigns to compromise a single maintainer's trust. However, Nix
Seed fundamentally alters the adversary's risk profile:

1. **No Silent CI Injections:** The attacker cannot silently compromise a
   build runner to inject a payload into the artifact. They *must* commit the
   backdoor to the public Git repository to pass the N-of-M quorum digest
   check.
2. **Forced Attribution:** By forcing the attack into the source tree, the
   adversary's actions become a publicly auditable Git crime. The malicious
   artifact is permanently, cryptographically bound to the specific commit and
   the identities of the independent builders who attested to it.

[HUMINT][humint] recruitment of build-system maintainers is not addressed by
any technical control. Key ceremony discipline and [HSM][hsm]-resident keys
limit insider blast radius: an insider can attest a bad build, but cannot
retroactively forge the quorum.

### Project Attack Surface

This project is intentionally low-code: it mainly defines build policy,
verification rules, and workflow wiring around existing Nix container systems.
That limits direct application attack surface because there is little custom
runtime logic to exploit.

The primary risk is **misconfiguration**, not complex code execution. The
highest-impact failure modes are:

- weak quorum/independence configuration
- enabling [substituters][substituter] in [L2][l2] mode
- trusting unsigned or under-specified [attestations][attestation]
- insecure key handling in CI

Security work should prioritize strict defaults, immutable references,
verification-by-default, and auditable configuration.

## Threat Actors

### USA

The global internet suffers from acute jurisdictional centralization:
US-based [ICANN][icann] controls domain name resolution and root [DNS][dns];
the majority of root certificate authorities are also US-based; [BGP][bgp]
routing registries are US-operated; and every major hyperscaler is either
US-incorporated or subject to US jurisdiction.

This is not merely a legal posture - it is the physical and organizational
topology of the internet.

#### Legal

All public cloud providers are subject to the [CLOUD Act][cloud-act], FISA
[Section 702][fisa-702], and [National Security Letters][nsl], any of which
can compel infrastructure access without public notice. NSLs require no
judicial approval and carry a gag order.

Executive branch volatility and the consolidation of unitary power mean that
internal US institutional guardrails cannot be relied upon. The legal apparatus
to silently compromise core infrastructure exists, and its use is subject
entirely to the domestic political climate of a single sovereign nation.

> [!WARNING]

> *"Sovereign Cloud" is a bullshit marketing term*: Providers claiming
> jurisdictional isolation remain US-operated entities under US law. An AWS EU
> Region is still Amazon. An Azure Government cloud is still Microsoft.
> Jurisdiction follows the operator, not the data center. CI platforms

A relevant EU counter-trend is the **Gaia-X Level 3 initiative** for stronger
European operational sovereignty and assurance baselines; treat it as useful
procurement signal, not a cryptographic substitute for independent quorum
builders and key custody controls.

A quorum composed entirely of US-headquartered CI providers is a single failure
domain. Practically, a meaningful quorum requires that at least one quorum
builder be:

1. Hosted on hardware controlled by an organization incorporated outside of
   the US.
1. Operated in a jurisdiction with no mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT)
   with the US, or with significant friction in its execution.

Legal compulsion to *attest a specific digest* - a builder operator required
under gag order to submit a false result - is not addressed by the
cryptographic design. Quorum limits the damage: an adversary must coerce N
independent operators simultaneously, across independent jurisdictions.

#### Extra-legal

Legal process is the slow path. NSA has other options.

##### Five Eyes

Tphe UKUSA agreement extends NSA collection to GCHQ (UK), CSE
(Canada), ASD (Australia), and GCSB (New Zealand). A builder in any Five Eyes
jurisdiction is not meaningfully separate from a US builder.

##### Active network attack

QUANTUM INSERT allows injection of malicious content into unencrypted or
MITM-able traffic. BGP hijacking has been used to redirect traffic through
collection points. DNS manipulation is within documented capability.

##### Hardware interdiction

TAO's ANT catalog documents implants for network equipment, hard drives, and
server hardware. Supply chains routed through US logistics are interdiction
targets.

> [!NOTE]

> Purely non-US COTS hardware is a practical impossibility; the mitigation

##### PRISM

Builder keys stored in CI secret stores on US-provider infrastructure are
accessible via PRISM without.

- Use Ed25519 over P-256 for all signing operations.
- Store genesis and builder keys in HSMs, not CI secret store environment
  variables. A hardware token that cannot exfiltrate the private key raises
  the cost of compromise significantly.
- At least one quorum builder should be on non-Five-Eyes infrastructure with a
  documented, audited supply chain.
- The Zero contract design already provides the strongest available
  mitigation: N independent signers on N independent hardware stacks must all
  be compromised simultaneously. Cost scales with N.

No software-only solution running on commodity cloud hardware in an automated
CI environment is proof against a well-resourced adversary with hardware
access. The goal is not to be NSA-proof - that requires air-gapped hardware
signing ceremonies outside the scope of CI. The goal is to make passive
supply-chain compromise of a *release* require active, targeted, multi-system
attack that is detectable, attributable, and expensive.

### China

China's National Intelligence Law (2017) compels any Chinese entity - including
Alibaba Cloud - to cooperate with intelligence services on demand and without
disclosure. A quorum that includes Alibaba Cloud or any runner operated by a
Chinese-headquartered entity is not legally independent.

PLA Unit 61398 and MSS-linked groups (APT10, APT41) have demonstrated
sustained supply-chain targeting, including software-update hijacking and
build-server compromise. Zero raises the cost: simultaneous compromise of N
independent builder networks, across independent jurisdictions, is required to
forge a quorum.

### Russia

SUNBURST (SolarWinds) is the canonical build-pipeline attack: GRU / SVR
operators compromised the SolarWinds Orion build system and inserted a backdoor
that was signed with the legitimate code-signing key. A multi-builder quorum
would not have prevented a single-builder build compromise - but would have
caught it: independent builders would attest a *different* digest, breaking
quorum and blocking promotion.

SORM requires Russian ISPs to provide FSB with real-time access to all traffic.
Runners in Russia or on Russian cloud infrastructure are subject to passive
interception regardless of TLS. Reproducible builds mean an observer who
intercepts a build gets the same artifact but cannot inject code without
breaking the digest.

## Governance

This project aims to become part of the
[nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community) organisation. Nix Community
hosts projects under [shared ownership](https://nix-community.org/),
supporting multi-person authorisation over releases and repository access.
This aligns with the trust model: the project's own supply chain is subject to
the same independence constraints it imposes on its users.

## Versioning

Releases are tagged twice: once as `N` (e.g. `1`) and once as `vN` (e.g.
`v1`), both pointing to the same commit. The `v` prefix is a cargo-cult
convention inherited from shell scripting era filenames; it carries no semantic
content. The canonical tag is `N`. The `vN` alias exists because GitHub Actions
consumers expect it - `uses: org/repo@v1` is the pattern every GHA user has
memorised. Both refs resolve identically.

## Compliance

Seed images fully respect upstream licences prohibiting redistribution. Seed
images do not contain the Apple SDK, they reference it at build time and on
macOS hosts.
