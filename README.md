# Nix Seed

Nix on non-native ephemeral CI: happy-path (app source change only) **build
starts in seconds**.

Dependency closure ships as content-addressed OCI layers. Explicit trust anchors
with 3 trust modes.

> Supply chain, secured: $$$
>
> Dependencies realized, once: $$$.
>
> Flow state, uninterrupted: Priceless.

Nix Seed has three trust modes. Choose one, based on your risk tolerance and
budget.

### Trust Level: Innocent

> IDGAF about trust. Gimme the Fast!
>
> - Every Engineer Born of Woman.

[Innocent](./DESIGN.md#innocent) anchors trust on the Rekor public-good instance
with a single builder.

- Guarantee: None.
- Attack Surface: Builder, Rekor, and Nix cache infra - all central actors, all
  [.gov](./DESIGN.md#usa)-capturable.
- Resiliency: Rekor has no SLA; downtime blocks build and verify.
- Cost: Free.

### Trust Level: Credulous

> I Want To Believe.
>
> - Fox Mulder, The X-Files, 1993

[Credulous](./DESIGN.md#credulous) anchors trust on the Rekor public-good
instance with an N-of-M independent builder quorum.

When the configured builder quorum is reached, the Master Builder creates a
signed git tag (format configurable) on the source commit.

- Guarantee: No builder, organisation, or jurisdiction, **apart from
  [.gov](./DESIGN.md#usa) or a compromised Master Builder**, can forge a
  release.
- Attack Surface: As for [Innocent](#trust-level-innocent). The Master Builder,
  as a central actor, is a juicy target.
- Resiliency: As for [Innocent](#trust-level-innocent).
- Cost: Free.

### Trust Level: Zero

> In God we trust. All others must bring data.
>
> - W. Edwards Deming, c. 1980

[Zero](./DESIGN.md#zero) anchors trust on an Ethereum L2 smart contract with an
N-of-M independent builder quorum.

- Guarantee: Hard Math. No builder, organisation, or jurisdiction can forge a
  release. Source:
  - **Full-Source Bootstrap**
  - **Immutable Ledger**
  - **No Central Actor**
  - **Contract-Enforced Builder Independence**
- Attack Surface: Misconfiguration, governance keys,
  [hardware interdiction](./DESIGN.md#hardware-interdiction).
- Resiliency: High.
- Cost (assuming 3 builders across 4 systems): 0.001 to 0.003 ETH ($3 to $9 at
  ETH = $3,000).

## Quickstart/Evaluation

This section details the minimum setup to evaluate Nix Seed on GitHub Actions.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Do not use [Innocent](#trust-level-innocent) in production. Minimum:
> [Credulous](#trust-level-credulous).

Add `nix-seed` to your flake and expose `seed` and `seedCfg`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nix-seed = {
      url = "github:0compute/nix-seed/v1";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    systems.url = "github:nix-systems/default";
  };

  outputs = inputs: {
    packages =
      inputs.nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs (import inputs.systems) (
        system:
        let
          pkgs = inputs.nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
        in
        {
          # placeholder: replace
          default = pkgs.hello;
          # seed is passed flake self; it realizes inputs for all flake outputs
          seed = inputs.nix-seed.lib.mkSeed {
            inherit pkgs;
            inherit (inputs) self;
          };
        }
      );
    seedCfg.trust = "innocent";
  };
}
```

## Production Configuration

> The [design doc](./DESIGN.md) details critical security information.
>
> Read it. Twice. Or, get pwned.

For production, update `seedCfg`:

- set `trust = "credulous"`
- define `builders`
- define `quorum`

See [Threat Actors](./DESIGN.md#threat-actors) for builder-independence
guidance.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is the only option until [Zero](#trust-level-zero) is implemented. Refer
> to [Credulous](#trust-level-credulous) for guarantee and attack surface
> detail.

```nix
# in flake outputs
seedCfg = {
  trust = "credulous";
  builders = {
    github.master = true;
    gitlab = { };
    scaleway = { };
  };
  # allow 1 builder to be down without blocking quorum
  quorum = 2;
};
```

`nix-seed` includes a sync helper that creates and configures builder repos to
mirror the source repository. Provider credential tokens must be set in the
environment.

```sh
nix run github:0compute/nix-seed/v1#sync
```
