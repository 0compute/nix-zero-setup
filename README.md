# Nix Zero Setup

A pattern and toolkit for ultra-fast, reproducible GitHub Actions workflows using
Nix-built containers

## The Problem

Standard Nix CI workflows often look like this:

1. Spin up a generic runner (`ubuntu-latest`)
1. Install Nix (e.g., via `install-nix-action`)
1. Configure caches (Magic Nix Cache, Cachix)
1. Fetch flake inputs
1. **Finally** build your project

Steps 2-4 take time, bandwidth, and API calls on *every single job*. While Nix caching
helps, you still pay the "setup tax" repeatedly

## The Solution: Pre-baked Containers

Instead of configuring the environment at runtime, **bake your build inputs into a
Docker container** using Nix, push it to GHCR, and run your CI jobs *inside* that
container

### Advantages

1. **Instant Startup**: The environment is ready immediately. No `install-nix-action`,
   no apt installs, no waiting
1. **Strict Reproducibility**: The CI container is built from the same lockfile as your
   project. If it works in the container locally, it works in CI
1. **Efficient Caching**: We use `pkgs.dockerTools.buildLayeredImageWithNixDb`. This
   creates Docker layers corresponding to Nix store paths. If you only change your
   source code, the heavy dependency layers (compilers, libraries) remain cached and are
   pulled instantly
1. **Hermeticity**: Your build environment is isolated from the host runner. No
   interference from pre-installed GitHub Action tools
1. **Azure Backbone Performance**: Since GHCR and GitHub Actions both run on Azure,
   image pulls happen over the internal high-speed backbone. This means massive
   bandwidth, zero egress costs, negligible latency, and higher reliability compared to
   external registries

## How It Works

1. **Define a Container**: Use the provided `mkBuildContainer` helper in your
   `flake.nix` to create a Docker image containing Nix, Git, and your project's build
   inputs
1. **Build & Push**: A dedicated `self-build` app builds this container and pushes it to
   the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
1. **Run CI**: Your main CI workflow specifies `container: ghcr.io/owner/repo:tag`

## Usage

### 1. Import the Library

Add this flake as an input:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    systems.url = "github:nix-systems/default";
    flake-utils = {
      url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
      inputs.systems.follows = "systems";
    };
    nix-zero-setup = {
      url = "github:your-org/nix-zero-setup";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
  # ..
}
```

### 2. Define Your Build Container

In your `flake.nix` outputs:

```nix
  outputs =
    inputs:
    inputs.flake-utils.lib.eachSystem (import inputs.systems) (
      system:
      let
        pkgs = inputs.nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in
      {
        packages.build-container = inputs.nix-zero-setup.lib.mkBuildContainer {
          inherit pkgs;
          # automatically include dependencies from your main package
          inputsFrom = [ inputs.self.packages.${system}.default ];
          # or add extra packages manually
          contents = with pkgs; [
            jq
            ripgrep
          ];
        };
      }
    );
```

### 3. Setup the Push Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/container.yml` to update the container when dependencies
change. You can use our provided GitHub Action to simplify this:

```yaml
name: Build Container
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - flake.lock
      - flake.nix

jobs:
  push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      packages: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: your-org/nix-zero-setup@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          container_attr: .#build-container
```

### 4. Use in Your Main Workflow

In your main `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  - push
  - pull_request

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # run directly inside the pre-baked environment
    container: ghcr.io/your-org/my-project-build:latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - run: nix build
      - run: nix flake check
```

## Examples

We provide several reference implementations demonstrating how to bake different types
of heavy build environments:

- **[Python (ML Stack)](examples/python):** Demonstrates baking a heavy Machine Learning
  environment (PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas) using `pyproject-nix`. This avoids re-downloading
  and re-linking massive Python wheels on every CI run
- **[C++ (Boost)](examples/cpp-boost):** Shows how to include system-level libraries
  like Boost and build tools (CMake, Ninja, GCC) in the container, skipping the overhead
  of compiling or installing these dependencies at runtime
- **[Rust (Toolchain)](examples/rust-app):** Illustrates baking the full Rust toolchain
  (`cargo`, `rustc`, `clippy`, `rust-analyzer`) into the image, eliminating the need to
  download and setup Rust for each job
